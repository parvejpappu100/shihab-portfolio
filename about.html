    <p>
      Hi, this is me Fardin Hasan Shihab . I live in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in a neighborhood called Tejgaon . I’m a student. I try my best to be on time for everything I do throughout the day. When it comes to food, I prefer simple and healthy meals like dal and rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm doing the <strong>Programming Hero Web Development Course</strong>. I already have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, DOM, and React.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to get a permanent job at <strong>some company</strong> as a Web Developer before completing my BSc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love problem solving and I'm solving <strong>10 JavaScript tasks per day</strong> to improve my skills. I’m also preparing for the <strong> </strong> which is my dream to crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in hard work, consistency, and I have strong faith in Allah.
    </p>
